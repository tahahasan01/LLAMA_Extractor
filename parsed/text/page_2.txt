Customer satisfaction scores remain high at 4.6/5.0, with particular strength in product reliability and
customer service responsiveness. The average customer lifetime value increased to $2,847, up from
$2,654 in Q1 2023. Our enterprise customer segment (1000+ employees) continues to show strong
growth, now representing 58% of total revenue. Mid-market customers (100-999 employees) represent
28% of revenue, while small business customers account for 14%. Customer churn rate improved to
5.8% from 7.2% in the previous quarter, indicating better retention and satisfaction. The implementation
of our new customer success program has shown measurable impact.

CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
Supply chain disruptions in Q1 resulted in a 3-day average delay in product delivery. We've
implemented new logistics partnerships with FedEx and UPS to mitigate this issue. Early results show
improvement in delivery times. The upcoming launch of our cloud-based CloudMax platform in Q2 is
expected to drive significant growth, with early beta testing showing 89% positive feedback from
enterprise clients. Pre-orders have already exceeded $2.1 million. Talent acquisition remains
challenging in the competitive tech market. We've increased our recruitment budget by 25% and are
expanding our remote work policies to access broader talent pools.

FINANCIAL OUTLOOK
Management projects Q2 2024 revenue of $13.8-14.2 million, representing 18-22% year-over-year
growth. The company is well-positioned to achieve full-year revenue guidance of $58-62 million. Key
drivers for Q2 include: • CloudMax platform launch expected to contribute $1.5-2.0 million • Continued
strength in enterprise segment • European market expansion • New partnership agreements in
Asia-Pacific We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong shareholder value while investing in
future growth.
