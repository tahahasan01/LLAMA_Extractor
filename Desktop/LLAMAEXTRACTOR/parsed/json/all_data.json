European expansion\nshows promising growth at 28% increase, driven by successful partnerships in Germany and France.\nAsia-Pacific operations grew by 45% though from a smaller base, with particular strength in Singapore\nand Australia markets.\n\n    Region        Q1 2024    % of Total    YoY Growth\n\nNorth America    $7,688,000     62%           +12%\n    Europe       $2,976,000     24%           +28%\n Asia-Pacific    $1,240,000     10%           +45%\n    Other         $496,000       4%           +8%\n\nCUSTOMER ANALYSIS\nCustomer satisfaction scores remain high at 4.6/5.0, with particular strength in product reliability and\ncustomer service responsiveness. The average customer lifetime value increased to $2,847, up from\n$2,654 in Q1 2023. Our enterprise customer segment (1000+ employees) continues to show strong\ngrowth, now representing 58% of total revenue. Mid-market customers (100-999 employees) represent\n28% of revenue, while small business customers account for 14%.

The implementation\nof our new customer success program has shown measurable impact.\n\nCHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES\nSupply chain disruptions in Q1 resulted in a 3-day average delay in product delivery.
